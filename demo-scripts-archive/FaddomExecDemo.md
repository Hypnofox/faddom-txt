<p>“Before we jump into the product, here is the one-minute context.”</p>
<p>Faddom is a hybrid IT observability and dependency mapping platform recognized by Gartner in 2025 as a stand-alone, agentless tool designed for migrations, risk reduction, cloud acceleration, and operational clarity.</p>
<p>The value is simple.<br>
Fast deployment. Instant visibility. Always accurate topology.</p>
<p>Faddom deploys in under an hour, runs agentless and can operate fully offline, keeps all data on-prem, and integrates with VMware, Hyper V, AWS, Azure, GCP and Nutanix.</p>
<p>Aligned with ISO 27001 and approved for sensitive environments.</p>
<p>Faddom delivers reliable, real-time visibility without agents or instrumentation. Credentials are only required for optional enrichments such as CVEs, user discovery and hypervisor integration.</p>

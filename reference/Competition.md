<h3 id="to-be-used-side-by-side-with-your-demo-script"><em>To be used side-by-side with your Demo Script</em></h3>
<p>This sheet is designed so you can glance once and immediately know what to say next.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-use-apm-dynatrace-appd-datadog-new-relic"><strong>1. If they use APM (Dynatrace, AppD, Datadog, New Relic)</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say">What to say</h3>
<p>“Great. APM tools give you deep visibility into critical servers, but they only cover the systems you deploy agents on. Faddom completes the picture by showing every dependency around those systems across the entire environment.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot-in-the-demo">Where to pivot in the demo</h3>
<p>→ <strong>Impact Set</strong><br>
→ <strong>Traffic Flow Map</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>APM sees performance. Faddom sees dependencies. They fit perfectly together.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-use-servicenow-discovery--lansweeper--device42--bmc-discovery"><strong>2. If they use ServiceNow Discovery / Lansweeper / Device42 / BMC Discovery</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say-1">What to say</h3>
<p>“These tools are great for inventory. What they don’t show is runtime behavior, direction, or application logic. Faddom gives you that behavioral mapping.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot">Where to pivot</h3>
<p>→ <strong>Traffic Flow</strong><br>
→ <strong>Subnet Dependencies</strong><br>
→ <strong>Baseline changes</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner-1">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>Discovery shows you what exists. Faddom shows you how it behaves.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-use-guardicore--nsx--aci--nutanix-flow"><strong>3. If they use Guardicore / NSX / ACI / Nutanix Flow</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say-2">What to say</h3>
<p>“These are enforcement layers. Ninety percent of micro-segmentation is planning. Faddom gives you the plan and validates it.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot-1">Where to pivot</h3>
<p>→ <strong>List View for microsegmentation</strong><br>
→ <strong>Subnet Dependencies</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner-2">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>Enforcement is useless without planning. Faddom is the planning layer.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-use-nagios--zabbix--logicmonitor--solarwinds"><strong>4. If they use Nagios / Zabbix / LogicMonitor / SolarWinds</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say-3">What to say</h3>
<p>“These tools tell you when something is wrong. Faddom shows you why things are wrong by revealing dependencies.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot-2">Where to pivot</h3>
<p>→ <strong>RCA Charts</strong><br>
→ <strong>Impact Set</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner-3">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>Monitoring shows symptoms. Faddom shows root causes.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-use-tenable--rapid7--qualys--wiz"><strong>5. If they use Tenable / Rapid7 / Qualys / Wiz</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say-4">What to say</h3>
<p>“Vulnerability scanners give you technical severity. Faddom tells you business impact. That’s how you prioritize correctly.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot-3">Where to pivot</h3>
<p>→ <strong>Security → Servers at Risk</strong><br>
→ <strong>Impact Set on a vulnerable server</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner-4">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>A CVE is only critical if the server is critical. Faddom gives the context.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-use-netbrain--auvik--whatsup-gold"><strong>6. If they use NetBrain / Auvik / WhatsUp Gold</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say-5">What to say</h3>
<p>“These map physical network devices. Faddom maps business applications and dependencies on top of that network. Two completely different layers.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot-4">Where to pivot</h3>
<p>→ <strong>Subnet Dependencies</strong><br>
→ <strong>Traffic Flow overview</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner-5">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>Auvik shows routers. Faddom shows the applications running on them.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-use-any-cmdb-servicenow-bmc-freshworks-device42"><strong>7. If they use any CMDB (ServiceNow, BMC, Freshworks, Device42)</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say-6">What to say</h3>
<p>“CMDBs store data. They don’t create dependency maps. Faddom enriches your CMDB automatically.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot-5">Where to pivot</h3>
<p>→ <strong>Exports (Visio/CSV)</strong><br>
→ <strong>Search + Map</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner-6">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>CMDB is static. Faddom keeps it alive.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-already-have-“some-mapping-tool”"><strong>8. If they already have “some mapping tool”</strong></h1>
<p>(Customer sometimes says: <em>“We already map our apps manually.”</em>)</p>
<h3 id="what-to-say-7">What to say</h3>
<p>“Perfect. That means you already feel the pain. Manual mapping is slow, fragile, and outdated the moment you finish it. Faddom keeps it accurate every minute with real traffic.”</p>
<h3 id="where-to-pivot-6">Where to pivot</h3>
<p>→ <strong>Baseline → Compare</strong><br>
→ <strong>Tiering in Application Map</strong><br>
→ <strong>Purple new connections</strong></p>
<h3 id="one-liner-7">One-liner</h3>
<p><strong>If you maintain your maps manually, you don’t really have maps.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-say-“we-use-x-to-do-y-so-why-do-we-need-faddom”"><strong>9. If they say: “We use X to do Y, so why do we need Faddom?”</strong></h1>
<h3 id="instant-universal-response">Instant universal response</h3>
<p>“Because Faddom solves a different and complementary problem. Let me show you.”</p>
<p>Pivot to:<br>
→ <strong>Search</strong><br>
→ <strong>Traffic Flow</strong><br>
→ <strong>Impact Set</strong></p>
<p>These are impossible to argue with.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-ask-about-price-vs-competitor"><strong>10. If they ask about price vs competitor</strong></h1>
<h3 id="what-to-say-8">What to say</h3>
<p>“Agent based tools multiply cost per server. Faddom is agentless and maps your entire environment for the price of mapping a few servers in APM. That’s why customers run both.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-ask-about-intrusion--performance-impact"><strong>11. If they ask about intrusion / performance impact</strong></h1>
<h3 id="one-sentence">One sentence</h3>
<p>“Zero agents. Zero DPI. Zero overhead.”</p>
<p>Pivot to:<br>
→ <strong>Offline Mode explanation</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-ask-about-segmentation"><strong>12. If they ask about segmentation</strong></h1>
<h3 id="one-sentence-1">One sentence</h3>
<p>“You cannot enforce policy until you understand dependencies. That is where Faddom comes in.”</p>
<p>Pivot to:<br>
→ <strong>List View</strong><br>
→ <strong>Subnet Dependencies</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="if-they-bring-up-a-tool-you-don’t-recognize"><strong>13. If they bring up a tool you don’t recognize</strong></h1>
<p>Use this fallback line:</p>
<h3 id="universal-competitive-catch-all"><strong>Universal competitive catch-all</strong></h3>
<p>“That tool solves a different part of the problem. Let me show where Faddom fits in your stack.”</p>
<p>Then pivot to:<br>
→ <strong>Traffic Flow</strong><br>
→ <strong>Impact Set</strong><br>
→ <strong>Subnet Dependencies</strong></p>
<p>These three screens beat 90 percent of competitors instantly.</p>

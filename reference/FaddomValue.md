<hr>
<h1 id="opening-framing-—-why-we’re-here"><strong>1. Opening Framing — Why We’re Here</strong></h1>
<p>“Thank you for your time today. What I want to show you is how Faddom gives you something that is very difficult to get today: <strong>a real-time, accurate picture of how your environment actually works.</strong></p>
<p>Not how it’s documented.<br>
Not how someone thinks it behaves.<br>
But how it truly runs — right now, in production.</p>
<p>Once you have that, things that were hard suddenly become simple: migrations, incident root cause, segmentation, cloud moves, cost planning, and security.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-core-problem-every-company-has"><strong>2. The Core Problem Every Company Has</strong></h1>
<p>“Every organization today has the same challenge:<br>
You have a mix of legacy systems, virtual infrastructure, cloud workloads, Kubernetes, SaaS, physical hardware, and shadow servers you inherited.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows what talks to what.</p>
<p>Documentation is outdated the moment it is written, CMDBs are bloated and inaccurate, and tribal knowledge is often in the heads of two or three people.</p>
<p>And that lack of visibility shows itself at the worst possible moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>During an outage</li>
<li>During a migration</li>
<li>During a cyber incident</li>
<li>During an audit</li>
<li>During maintenance windows</li>
<li>During staff turnover</li>
</ul>
<p>Faddom exists to eliminate that blind spot permanently.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="what-faddom-delivers-—-in-business-terms"><strong>3. What Faddom Delivers — in Business Terms</strong></h1>
<p>“What Faddom gives you is the ability to answer any question about your environment instantly — without agents, without manual mapping, and without guesswork.</p>
<p>Questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will break if we move this system?</li>
<li>What depends on this server we want to retire?</li>
<li>How does this application actually work end-to-end?</li>
<li>What unexpected connections exist right now?</li>
<li>Which servers are communicating in ways they shouldn’t?</li>
<li>What is the real blast radius of an incident or vulnerability?</li>
<li>How do we segment safely without shutting down the business?</li>
</ul>
<p>It becomes your <strong>source of truth for runtime behavior</strong>.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="replace-tribal-knowledge-with-evidence"><strong>4. Replace Tribal Knowledge With Evidence</strong></h1>
<p>“Faddom takes your entire environment — across on-prem, cloud, and containers — and transforms it into evidence:</p>
<p>Real traffic<br>
Real dependencies<br>
Real behavior<br>
Real impact</p>
<p>Not theory.<br>
Not assumptions.<br>
Not documentation from two years ago.</p>
<p>This is important because <strong>traffic does not lie</strong>.<br>
It’s the one thing that always reflects reality.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="strategic-value-1-risk-reduction"><strong>5. Strategic Value #1: Risk Reduction</strong></h1>
<p>“Most crises in IT happen because of unknown dependencies.</p>
<p>Some change seems safe, and suddenly:</p>
<ul>
<li>payroll stops</li>
<li>ERP collapses</li>
<li>database locks</li>
<li>DNS loops</li>
<li>O365 authentication breaks</li>
</ul>
<p>With Faddom, before you touch anything, you already know:</p>
<ul>
<li>who relies on it</li>
<li>what systems it supports</li>
<li>what unexpected connections exist</li>
<li>how critical it is to the business</li>
</ul>
<p>This means fewer outages, fewer incidents, fewer surprises.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="strategic-value-2-faster-migrations--modernization"><strong>6. Strategic Value #2: Faster Migrations &amp; Modernization</strong></h1>
<p>“Cloud migrations break when hidden dependencies show up too late.</p>
<p>Same with datacenter exits.<br>
Same with VMware → KVM/Nutanix shifts.<br>
Same with application modernization.</p>
<p>Faddom reduces migrations from guesswork to planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>We show you the real dependencies</li>
<li>We identify what must move together</li>
<li>We group servers into migration waves</li>
<li>We help estimate sizing and costs</li>
<li>We reduce time, risk, and rework</li>
</ul>
<p>You move faster — and with confidence.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="strategic-value-3-stronger-security-and-zero-trust"><strong>7. Strategic Value #3: Stronger Security and Zero Trust</strong></h1>
<p>“Most security gaps live in the shadows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lateral movement you don’t see</li>
<li>Legacy servers nobody knew about</li>
<li>Forgotten interfaces</li>
<li>Unknown East-West communication</li>
<li>Unexpected outbound traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Faddom makes that visible in minutes.</p>
<p>Your security team gets:</p>
<ul>
<li>real-time anomalous traffic</li>
<li>rogue communication detection</li>
<li>vulnerability exposure context</li>
<li>segmentation planning</li>
<li>attack-path visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>This turns Zero Trust from a slide-deck idea into an actually implementable project.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="strategic-value-4-kubernetes-without-the-chaos"><strong>8. Strategic Value #4: Kubernetes Without the Chaos</strong></h1>
<p>“Kubernetes is dynamic — pods come and go constantly.</p>
<p>Mapping them is useless.</p>
<p>What matters to the business is <strong>service-to-service</strong> communication, not pod-to-pod.</p>
<p>Faddom simplifies Kubernetes to the same level as the rest of your environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>stable service dependencies</li>
<li>clear traffic paths</li>
<li>consistent visibility</li>
<li>one map, one language</li>
</ul>
<p>This removes the chaos and exposes the logic.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="strategic-value-5-cmdb-accuracy"><strong>9. Strategic Value #5: CMDB Accuracy</strong></h1>
<p>“CMDBs fail because they try to map every detail.<br>
Faddom fixes that by focusing only on <strong>runtime truth</strong>.</p>
<p>You get:</p>
<ul>
<li>clean, accurate dependencies</li>
<li>automatic updates</li>
<li>no manual work</li>
<li>no guessing</li>
<li>no noise</li>
</ul>
<p>Your CMDB becomes something people trust.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="strategic-value-6-faster-troubleshooting"><strong>10. Strategic Value #6: Faster Troubleshooting</strong></h1>
<p>“During an outage, the question is always the same:</p>
<p><strong>What changed, and what is impacted?</strong></p>
<p>With Faddom:</p>
<ul>
<li>You see the dependency chain instantly</li>
<li>You see abnormal traffic</li>
<li>You see what’s downstream</li>
<li>You see blast radius</li>
<li>You see who is affected</li>
</ul>
<p>Mean time to resolution drops dramatically.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="minimal-overhead-—-maximum-control"><strong>11. Minimal Overhead — Maximum Control</strong></h1>
<p>“Everything stays in your environment.<br>
Nothing leaves.<br>
No traffic is sent to the cloud.<br>
No sensitive logs leave your premises.</p>
<p>You stay in control of:</p>
<ul>
<li>data</li>
<li>privacy</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>legal compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>This matters more today than ever before.”</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="closing-value-message"><strong>12. Closing Value Message</strong></h1>
<p>“Faddom is not just a mapping tool.<br>
It’s a way to run your infrastructure with clarity instead of assumptions.</p>
<p>It gives IT, security, and business leaders the same picture, the same truth, the same understanding.</p>
<p>Every decision becomes safer.<br>
Every project becomes faster.<br>
Every incident becomes easier.</p>
<p>And all of it is driven by how your environment behaves <strong>right now</strong>, in reality, not on paper.”</p>

<h2 id="opening-30–60-seconds"><strong>Opening (30–60 seconds)</strong></h2>
<p>“Before we dive in, the key idea is simple:<br>
Faddom gives you <strong>complete, real-time, agentless visibility</strong> across hybrid IT. Everything you’ll see today is collected passively, stored locally, and mapped automatically — no agents, no credentials, no intrusive deployments.”</p>

<h1 id="dashboard-—-instant-discovery--visibility"><strong>1. Dashboard — Instant Discovery &amp; Visibility</strong></h1>
<h3 id="opening-statement"><strong>Opening Statement</strong></h3>
<p>“This is the front door of Faddom. Every widget is customizable and can be adapted for operations, network, security, cloud, or management teams. It will make more sense once we walk through the flows — but the key point is: all your critical information can be centralized here.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Switching between dashboards</li>
<li>Creating a new one</li>
</ul>

<p>Walkthrough:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new map using <strong>traffic flow</strong> (e.g., 10.16.3.10).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show <strong>auto-tiering</strong>: client → app → backend.</p>
</li>

<p>Save the map quickly.<br>
“It’s that quick and easy to create an application map.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show <strong>baseline</strong>, <strong>current</strong>, and <strong>compare</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a baseline</li>
<li>Simulate a change</li>
<li>Show delta between versions</li>
<li>Mention that baselines support audits and change-management processes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Story:</strong><br>
“If an engineer goes on vacation, they no longer need emergency calls. They come back, open Compare, and instantly see everything that changed.”</p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong><br>
“All root-cause information lives here — connections, failures, timings, and dependencies. This dramatically cuts incident-response time.”</p>

# DEMO QUICK REFERENCE CARD
## Critical Moments to Emphasize - Don't Miss These!

---

## 🎯 THE 4 MOMENTS YOU SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT

### 1. SAVE SEARCH AS MAP (Section 2 - Search)
**Location:** After showing search results and list view

**The Action:**
Click "Save this search as a map"

**What to Emphasize:**
"And here's the magic - **one click**, this search becomes a **permanent map** that tracks changes automatically.

You don't build maps manually. You don't maintain them. You don't update them.

You search once, save it, and Faddom keeps it current forever."

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows how EASY map creation is
- Dynamic, not static documentation
- Self-maintaining - no manual work
- Transforms search into continuous monitoring

**Payoff Line:**
"Creating maps is literally this easy - search, save, done. No CMDBs to update, no documentation to maintain."

---

### 2. TAGS & AUTOMATIC IMPORT (Section 3 - Application Maps)
**Location:** After showing tier view, before saving the map

**The Action:**
Show tag filtering in application map or inventory

**What to Emphasize:**
"Here's something powerful - Faddom **automatically imports tags** from VMware, AWS, Azure, GCP, Nutanix. 

Cost center tags, environment tags, owner tags - everything.

You can build maps directly from tags. For example: Show me everything tagged 'Production-Finance'. **One click, automatic map, always current.**

The only platform that doesn't export tags automatically is Hyper-V - for those, you can import them manually or via API."

**Why This Matters:**
- Zero duplicate tagging work
- Leverages existing governance structure
- Finance/chargeback integration ready
- Shows the platform is smart, not dumb

**Payoff Line:**
"Your existing organizational structure - the tags your finance team uses for chargeback, the tags your cloud team uses for governance - they **instantly become powerful map filters** in Faddom. No duplicate tagging, no manual work."

**CPO/CRO Hook:**
This is about governance and cost allocation - their tags already work.

---

### 3. TIER VIEW (Section 3 - Application Maps)
**Location:** Right after the map builds from traffic flow

**The Action:**
Click to show Tier View (collapsed logical view)

**What to Emphasize:**
"Now watch this - I can collapse this into **logical tiers**. 

Instead of seeing 50 individual servers, you see: **web tier, app tier, database tier**.

This is how executives and application owners **want** to see their applications - by function, not by server name."

**Why This Matters:**
- Simplifies complexity
- Business language, not IT language
- Makes sprawling apps understandable
- Perfect for executive communication

**Visual Impact:**
50 boxes collapse into 3 clean tiers - instant clarity

**Payoff Line:**
"This transforms technical complexity into business understanding. Your application owners don't need to know server names - they need to know: web tier talks to app tier talks to database tier. Done."

**CPO Hook:**
Application owners (product managers, business stakeholders) can actually understand their own applications now.

### 4. USER DISCOVERY / AD INTEGRATION (Section 11)
**Location:** This is its own section - make sure you get here!

**The Action:**
- Show Users in Inventory
- Click on a user
- Open the user map

**What to Emphasize:**
"This is one of the **most underrated features**. Through Active Directory integration, Faddom shows you:

**First:** Which users logged into which servers and when.

**Second:** We map users to the applications they **actually depend on** to do their job.

**Third:** Security anomalies - dormant accounts, unusual access patterns, compromised credentials."

**The Three Value Props:**
1. **Change Management:** "When you take a server down for maintenance, you know exactly which users will be affected. No more surprise calls from the CEO saying 'I can't access my reports.'"

2. **Security:** "See this user who hasn't logged in for 90 days? That's a dormant account that should probably be disabled. See this user logging in from multiple servers at 3 AM? That might be legitimate... or it might be compromised."

3. **Offboarding:** "When someone leaves the company, you see exactly which systems they actually used - not what they were supposed to have access to according to AD groups, but what they actually used."

**Customer Story to Use:**
"A customer discovered a user account that had left the company 6 months ago, still actively logging into servers. Faddom caught the trace. That was a breach waiting to happen."

**Why This Matters:**
- Closes the security visibility gap
- Prevents the "CEO can't access reports" incident
- Compliance and audit gold
- Behavior-based security, not policy-based

**Payoff Line:**
"You can see exactly who will be affected when a server goes offline - bringing it full circle to the 'no more scream test' principle. **Be proactive, not reactive.**"

**CRO Hook:**
Preventing CEO-level incidents = protecting revenue operations

**CTO Hook:**
Security posture and compliance - dormant accounts, unusual access patterns

## 🎵 HOW TO REMEMBER THESE DURING THE DEMO

Think of it as a musical performance with 4 key signature moments:

**Movement 1: Search (Minutes 10-17)**
→ SAVE SEARCH AS MAP = "One click, permanent, self-updating"

**Movement 2: Application Maps (Minutes 17-30)**
→ TIER VIEW = "Business understanding, not server names"
→ TAGS = "Your governance structure already works here"

**Movement 3: Security/Users (Minutes 60-75 if time)**
→ USER DISCOVERY = "Who's affected, who's a risk, who left but didn't"

---

## 📋 PRE-DEMO CHECKLIST - VERIFY THESE WORK

Before the executives arrive, quickly verify:

✅ **Search:** Type VLAN 3 (or your example) → Results appear → Can click "Save as Map"

✅ **Tags:** Open an application map or inventory → Confirm you can see tags → Know which tag you'll filter by

✅ **Tier View:** Open a complex application map → Confirm tier view button works → Practice the collapse

✅ **User Discovery:** Open Inventory → Users → Pick a user with activity → Confirm user map opens

**If any of these don't work, have a backup example ready.**

## 💡 EMPHASIS TECHNIQUES

### For "Save Search as Map":
- **Pause before clicking** - "And here's what matters..."
- **Click deliberately** - Let them see the button

### For "Tags":
- **Show the tag list first** - Let them see their own organizational structure
- **Then show how it filters** - "One click..."
- **Connect to their pain** - "No duplicate work..."

### For "Tier View":
- **Show the complex view first** - Let them feel overwhelmed
- **Then collapse it** - Visual transformation
- **Emphasize "business understanding"** - Not "feature"

### For "User Discovery":
- **Start with the security story** - "Dormant accounts, compromised credentials"

## 🚨 IF YOU'RE RUNNING SHORT ON TIME

**Must-hit moments in priority order:**

1. **Save Search as Map** (30 seconds) - This is in the first 15 minutes anyway
2. **Tier View** (45 seconds) - Part of app mapping, easy to show
3. **Tags** (60 seconds) - Huge governance value, quick to demonstrate
4. **User Discovery** (3 minutes) - Only if you have time

**If you only have 60 minutes total:**
- Hit moments 1-3 for sure
- Mention User Discovery exists but don't deep-dive unless they ask
